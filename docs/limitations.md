# Limitations

- Copilot CLI responses depend on local availability of a Copilot CLI backend.
- Set `REASONING_BACKEND=offline` to force offline mode, or `COPILOT_CLI_CMD` to override the Copilot CLI command.
- When Copilot CLI is unavailable, the tool falls back to lightweight offline suggestions.
