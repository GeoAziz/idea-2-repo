# Dependency Choices

## Suggested Packages

- **Offline suggestion:**
- **Consider starting with a clear README, a src/ directory for implementation,**
- **and a tests/ folder for automated checks. Add docs/ for longer-form**
- **documentation and a config file (package.json, pyproject.toml, or similar)**
- **appropriate for your stack.**
